# radio-playlists
Scrape the artist and title names off the "currently playing" pages of
several FM and web radio stations.

The original purpose was to get data on the similarity of popular (commercially 
oriented) radio stations compared to radio stations focusing on indy music. As
an example on how to use this data, there is a simple cluster analysis (using R)
in the evaluation folder.
